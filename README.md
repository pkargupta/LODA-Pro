The LODA Project, also known as the Locate Damini Project, was created to aid people in emergency situations when there is no time available for the police to arrive. So far, this app provides a quick alert button to immediately notify your preset contacts with your exact GPS coordinates, address, and a preset message.
Features:
- Send a notification/alert SMS to the users' preset contacts (user is able to load them straight from their Google contacts OR manually add them)
- The number of contacts is unlimited
- Send an alert with a large one touch button
- Additional option of a custom-message alert
- Displays your current location and a remembered location (ex. home, a safe place, and etc.) These two can be used for directions or knowing where you are
(NOTE: Some phones may take a while to get its GPS location if you are indoors. If you are having a hard time getting GPS locations, try going outside. If there are still issues, try turning on your Wifi too. Please understand that this issue is not caused by the app. We apologize for the inconvenience)

This is the Pro Version of LODA. It is completely free, and it simply has a fresh new look to it and additional features. The previous version is listed as a separate app due to its shake and send SMS ability which this version does not app. We apologize for the inconvenience and are working on implementing that feature into this version! 
Please become a member of The LODA Project on our website (www.lodaproject.org)! We can work together to make this app more efficient!

 Inspiration for The LODA Project...

       On December 16th, 2012, a tragic event occurred in New Dehli, India. A young girl (23 years old) and her male friend were attacked and sexually abused on a bus. The attack was so violent that she was in extremely critical condition and had to undergo five surgeries as she suffered from brain damage, pneumonia, and abdominal infection. She died on December 29th, 2012. Her name remain unknown, however many call her Damini, which means 'lightning' in Hindi.
      This absolute tragedy helps one realize how anyone can be a victim to these sort of horrifying attacks and how it could have been prevented through immediate help. Apparently, they were left outside waiting for help, however no one came to help them. When I heard about this, I simply could not accept the fact that tragic events such as this would continue to happen. How can we stand and watch while someone is in need of urgent help? Then, I imagined how I would react to the situation if one of my loved ones were in the situation and decided that if anyone was in an emergency and informed all of their loved ones of it along with their location, many of them would definitely hurry to the situation. Then, even if I was limited in resources and knowledge as I am a middle school student, I decided along with my parents to act. Hopefully, as we improve the app, these tragedies will diminish.
